= DESCRIPTION:

This cookbook basically translates the install instructions from http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/Install+Sonar#InstallSonar-Server into chef DSL.

= REQUIREMENTS:

* java + jdk
* A database cookbook like 'mysql' if you like to run sonar in production. The built in derby database is not recommended for production. However, make sure 'bind-address' value is correctly configured in the MySQL side. Recommended configuration to work with this Sonar recipe:

    node['mysql']['bind_address'] = 'localhost'

= ATTRIBUTES:

See attributes/default.rb for details.

= USAGE:

The cookbook installs sonar with derby database (default).
Inlcude a proxy_* recipe to your run_list to access sonar over a proxy server.

= Todos

* Implement 'dir' attribute to make installation path more flexible
* Implement different Database backends like MySql
* Implement plugin recipes eg. http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/PHP+Plugin
  Download jars to plugin folder, restart Sonar
