TODO ct 2011-06-15 Enable AJP13 settings in config file

If you want to use this AJP13 protocol you must to activate the mod_proxy_ajp module and then edit the sonar.properties configuration file and uncomment the sonar.ajp13.port property :

# Apache mod_jk connector. Supported only in standalone mode.
# Uncomment to activate AJP13 connector.
# sonar.ajp13.port: 8009

Once this done, edit the HTTPd configuration file for the www.somecompany.com virtual host and make the following changes :

  ProxyPass / ajp://sonarhost:sonarajpport/
  ProxyPassReverse / ajp://sonarhost:sonarajpport/

Apache configuration is going to vary based on your own application's requirements and the way you intend to expose Sonar to the outside world. If you need more details about Apache HTTPd, mod_proxy and mod_proxy_ajp, please see http://httpd.apache.org.
